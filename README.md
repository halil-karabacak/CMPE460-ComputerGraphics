## Homework1: Ray Tracing on Spherical Objects

Ray tracing is a rendering technique used to generate an image by tracing the path of light as pixels in an image plane and simulating the effects of its encounters with virtual objects. When dealing with spherical objects in ray tracing, such as spheres, certain principles come into play.

### Libraries Used

 1. [STB](https://github.com/nothings/stb)  to output frame in PNG format.

### How to Use

 1. Clone the repository
 2. If you use MacOS or Linux based operating systems:
			 3. cmake ..
			 4. make
	
 3. If you use Windows, first you need to install Visual Studio tools and work with .sln files.
 4. After following these steps you will get an executable named RayTracer/RayTracer.exe.
